<ul>
<li>Evidence Lines are used to capture various pieces of information (i.e. 'evidence items') that are assessed together as an argument for or against some 'target proposition' - to report the direction (supports or disputes) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate, weak) that the argument is determined to make. For example, the various allele counts and population frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G variant in the ExAC database are evidence items that may be collectively assessed to build an EvidenceLine making argument of 'moderate' strength that 'supports' a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence Lines are flexible with respect to the granularity of arguments they support, and the scope of evidence items they can collectively assess. Narrow scoping will bucket available evidence into many, fine-grained Evidence Lines that make the most atomic independently meaningful arguments possible. The ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Interpretation Guidelines are an example of a fairly fine-grained evidence interpretation framework. Broader scoping approaches may organize the same evidence into fewer Evidence Lines that build and assess less atomic arguments based on a wider and more diverse set of evidence items.  For example, CIViC curators assess the strength and direction of evidence items at the level of <em>all information reported in a publication for a specific study</em> - which can encompass many different results and evidence types that under more fine-grained interpretation approaches might be split apart and assessed as separate arguments. </p>
<p>This CIViC EID5682 record (https://civicdb.org/evidence/5682/summary) is a clear example of this  as it illustrates how ACMG-curated evidence assessed at a finer-grained level would lend itself to SEPIO representations that creates a larger number of more atomic Evidence Lines, as compared to how CIViC-curated evidence from the same source or publication would be represented. We see here that CIViC evidence assessments are performed at the level of all results reported in PMID:23143947 - which SEPIO would capture as a single Evidence Line that assigns a strength (level C) and direction (supports) to the collective argument made by this evidence. However, as detailed in the free-text summary of this EID, the more fine-grained ACMG framework breaks out and separately assess two arguments here - one based on criterion PP1 (disease co-segregation evidence), and one based on criterion PP4 (highly specific gene-phenotype information) - which SEPIO woudl capture as two distinct Evidence Lines.</p>

      - The quality of information is one factor that goes into the confidence we
      have in the information''s veracity (i.e. that it is an accurate reflection
      of reality it intends to measure or describe). Other factors informing confidence
      may include who did it (we may just not trust some Agents), when (if data created
      500 years ago, we may have less confidence in it), and for Assertions, the relevance
      and abundance of supporting evidence.

      - Implementers should define a relevant source or specific set of terms to use
      here based on the needs of the domain or application.'

    - This attribute holds a structured RecordMetadata objects, which can be used
      to capture when, how, and by whom a record serialization was generated or modified;
      what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level administrative
      information such as versioning and lifecycle status.

      Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical
      ids - typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that is assigned
      to the data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer may choose
      to reuse an existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority
      for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique
      within the implementing system, and can be used to reference the identified
      object in this context.'

      A given real world entity - e.g. a genetic variant - may have many business
      identifiers defined by different systems, which can be captured in the ''identifiers''
      property to indicate that they represent the same thing.


      Preferred values for this attribute are CURIEs or URIs - so the system that
      provisioned the identifier is clear.'

      between systems.
