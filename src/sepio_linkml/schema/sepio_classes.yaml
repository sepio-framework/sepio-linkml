    title: Entity
    comments:
    - Entity is the root class of the 'gks-common' core information model. All common
      classes that have ids and other general metadata like label,  description, type,
      or extensions descend from this class and inherit its attributes.

    attributes:
      id:
        description: The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record,
          e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is unique within a given system, but may or may
          not be globally unique outside the system. It is used within a system to
          reference one object from another.
        comments:
        - Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical
          ids - typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that
          is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer
          may choose to reuse an existing, globally unique id from an external system
          or authority for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long
          as it is unique within the implementing system, and can be used to reference
          the identified object in this context.

          and share content across different systems.
        comments:
        - Preferred values for this attribute are CURIEs or URIs - so the system
          that provisioned the identifier is clear.
        - A given real world entity - e.g. a genetic variant - may have many business
          identifiers defined by different systems, which can be captured in the "identifiers"
          property to indicate that they represent the same thing.

        - Extension objects have a key-value data structure that allows definition
          of custom fields in the data itself. Extensions are not expected to be natively
          understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes

    title: Information Entity
    comments:
    - As abstract, non-physical entities, Information Entities represent information
      independent of any specific language, format, or physical/digital medium. They
      can be simultaneously concretized in many distinct physical artifacts (e.g.
      all physical copies of the first edition of "War and Peace" carry the same information
      content, and thus concretize the same Information Entity).

        comments:
        - e.g. In the context of a Statement object, this attribute may be used to
          indicate entities/concepts it is about, in lieu of providing a more precise
          description of what the Statement asserts to be true using subject, predicate,
          object, and qualifier properties. e.g. the Statement that "BRCA2 c.8023A>G
          is pathogenic for Breast Cancer" might be annotated to be about the variant
          'BRCA2 c.8023A>G', and the disease 'Breast Cancer'.

        comments:
        - The term 'authored' as used in the model refers to the generation of 'information
          content' in the abstract  sense, as opposed to a concrete encoding of this
          information in a specific language or format. e.g. for a Statement, this
          attribute captures when the information content expressed in the Statement
          was first generated by an agent.  Information about when a particular concrete
          encoding of this information was created (e.g. as row in a table, or object
          in a json document) would live in a RecordMetadata object attached to the
          Information Entity).

        - This is typically based on the quality of design and execution of the
          study or curation activity that generated it (e.g. were relevant controls
          assessed to show instruments were working, were all samples taken care of
          and handled identically, are methods sound and well documented, etc.).
        - The quality of information is intrinsic to the information itself, and
          not to a particular application of the information (e.g. as evidence for
          making an Assertion)
        - The quality of information is one factor that goes into the confidence
          we have in the information''s veracity (i.e. that it is an accurate reflection
          of reality it intends to measure or describe). Other factors informing confidence
          may include who did it (we may just not trust some Agents), when (if data
          created 500 years ago, we may have less confidence in it), and for Assertions,
          the relevance and abundance of supporting evidence.
        - Implementers should define a relevant source of codes or terms to use
          here, based on the needs of the domain or application.'

    title: Evidence Line
    comments:
    - "Evidence Lines are used to capture various pieces of information (i.e. 'evidence\
      \ items') that are assessed together as an argument for or against some 'target\
      \ proposition' - to report the direction (supports or disputes) and strength\
      \ (e.g. strong, moderate, weak) that the argument is determined to make. For\
      \ example, the various allele counts and population frequency calculations for\
      \ the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant in the ExAC database are evidence items that may\
      \ be collectively assessed to build an EvidenceLine making argument of 'moderate'\
      \ strength that 'supports' a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic\
      \ for Breast Cancer."
    - "Evidence Lines are flexible with respect to the granularity\
      \ of arguments they support, and the scope of evidence items they can collectively\
      \ assess. Narrow scoping will bucket available evidence into many, fine-grained\
      \ Evidence Lines that make the most atomic independently meaningful arguments\
      \ possible. The ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Interpretation Guidelines are an\
      \ example of a fairly fine-grained evidence interpretation framework. Broader\
      \ scoping approaches may organize the same available evidence into fewer Evidence\
      \ Lines that build and assess less atomic arguments based on a wider and more\
      \ diverse set of evidence items.  For example, CIViC curators assess the strength\
      \ and direction of evidence items at the level of *all information reported\
      \ in a publication for a specific study* - which can encompass many different\
      \ results and evidence types that under more fine-grained interpretation approaches\
      \ might be split apart and assessed as separate lines of evidence."
    - "This\
      \ CIViC EID5682 record (https://civicdb.org/evidence/5682/summary) is a clear\
      \ example of this - illustrating how ACMG-curated evidence assessed at a finer-grained\
      \ level would lend itself to SEPIO representations that creates a larger number\
      \ of more atomic Evidence Lines, as compared to how CIViC-curated evidence from\
      \ the same source or publication would be represented. We see here that CIViC\
      \ evidence assessments are performed at the level of all results reported in\
      \ PMID:23143947 - which SEPIO would capture as a single Evidence Line that assigns\
      \ a strength (level C) and direction (supports) to the collective argument made\
      \ by this evidence. However, as detailed in the free-text summary of this EID,\
      \ the more fine-grained ACMG framework breaks out and separately assess two\
      \ arguments here - one based on criterion PP1 (disease co-segregation evidence),\
      \ and one based on criterion PP4 (highly specific gene-phenotype information)\
      \ - which SEPIO woudl capture as two distinct Evidence Lines."

    title: Qualifier
    comments:
    - Qualifiers allow representation of more complex, n-ary statements that may not
      be accommodated by a simple subject-predicate-object (SPO) triple. For example,
      if a triple asserts that 'Variant X' - predicts sensitivity to - 'Treatment
      Y', a qualifier can be used to indicate that this applies in the context of
      a particular 'Disease Z'. Qualifiers can also add information that 'quantifies'
      aspects of a Statement - e.g. for a Statement triple asserting that a 'Variant
      X'- causes - 'Phenotype Y', a qualifier can be used to add frequency/penetrance
      information that quantifies the percentage of carriers in which the phenotype
      is observed to manifest.

    title: Record Metadata
    comments:
    - Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization
      of information (e.g as a record in a specific data/knowlegebase, or an online
      digital resource). A RecordMetadata object can capture when, how, and by whom
      a record serialization was generated or modified; what upstream resources it
      was derived or retrieved from; and record-level administrative information such
      as versioning and lifecycle status.

        comments:
        - This is needed only when the RecordMetadata object describes an upstream
          source record, as opposed to the record in the present system, so it is
          clear what the metadata it contains is about.  e.g. when ClinGen ingests
          and transforms ClinVar data, it wants to maintain a record of when the source
          ClinVar record was submitted and by whom.  A RecordMetadata object could
          be created that describes this upstream source record, including information
          about its submission to ClinVar.
