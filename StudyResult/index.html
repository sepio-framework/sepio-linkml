<ul>
<li>StudyResults provide a useful way to capture a subset of items from a study dataset that are used as evidence in generating higher order knowledge assertions about the entity that is the focus of the study result. For example, a subset of allele frequency data items about a particular variant of interest in the complete gnomAD dataset can be reported in a StudyResult object, along with relevant provenance information, so they can be referenced as evidence for a higher-order assertion about the variant's pathogenicity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, consider the comprehensive allele frequency dataset provided by gnomAD, which covers millions of variants. A curator looking to assess the pathogenicity of a particular variant might create a StudyResult object to capture a subset of data related to this focus allele, including  its count, frequency, homozygous frequency, along with metadata concerning the shared provenance or quality of this data.

    - The 'focus' of a StudyResult is the what anchors selection of all data items
      and provenance information that it contains. This focus may be a single participant
      or subject of a study (e.g. one patient in a clinical study, or one allele in
      a population frequency analysis). It may be a study group defined as an experimental
      unit in the study (e.g. a specific treatment arm of a clinical study). Or it
      may be a variable defined as a unit of analysis in the study (e.g. 'exposure
      to nicotine' in an analysis correlating this variable with clinical outcomes).

    comments:
    - The term 'authored' is used in the model to refer to the generation of abstract
      'information content', as opposed to creation of a concrete encoding of this
      information in a specific language, format, or physical artifact. e.g. for a
      Statement, this attribute captures when the information content expressed in
      the Statement was first  generated by an agent, and metadata about when a particular
      concrete encoding of this information was created (e.g. a written sentence in
      an article, or json object in a data stream) would live in a RecordMetadata
      object attached to the Information Entity).

    comments:
    - '- This is typically based on the quality of design and execution of the study
      or curation activity that generated it (e.g. were relevant controls assessed
      to show instruments were working, were all samples taken care of and handled
      identically, are methods sound and well documented, etc.).

      - The quality of information is intrinsic to the information itself, and not
      to a particular application of the information (e.g. as evidence for making
      an Assertion)

      - The quality of information is one factor that goes into the confidence we
      have in the information''s veracity (i.e. that it is an accurate reflection
      of reality it intends to measure or describe). Other factors informing confidence
      may include who did it (we may just not trust some Agents), when (if data created
      500 years ago, we may have less confidence in it), and for Assertions, the relevance
      and abundance of supporting evidence.

      - Implementers should define a relevant source or specific set of terms to use
      here based on the needs of the domain or application.'

    comments:
    - This attribute holds a structured RecordMetadata objects, which can be used
      to capture when, how, and by whom a record serialization was generated or modified;
      what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level administrative
      information such as versioning and lifecycle status.

      Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical
      ids - typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that is assigned
      to the data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer may choose
      to reuse an existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority
      for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique
      within the implementing system, and can be used to reference the identified
      object in this context.'

      A given real world entity - e.g. a genetic variant - may have many business
      identifiers defined by different systems, which can be captured in the ''identifiers''
      property to indicate that they represent the same thing.


      Preferred values for this attribute are CURIEs or URIs - so the system that
      provisioned the identifier is clear.'

      custom fields in the data itself. Extensions are not expected to be natively
      understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes
      between systems.
