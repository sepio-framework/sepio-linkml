description: A claim of purported truth as made by a particular agent, on a particular
  occasion. Statements may be used to simply put forth a possible fact (i.e. a 'proposition')
  as true, or to provide a more nuanced assessment of the level of confidence or evidence
  supporting a particular proposition.
title: Statement
comments:
- 'In the SEPIO model, primary assertions of knowledge about some subject entity is
  captured in self-contained Statement objects. Organization of assertions into discrete
  Statement objects allows clear and precise tracking of the evidence and provenance
  that supports each. Statement semantics are explicitly captured using ''subject'',
  ''predicate'', and ''object'' attributes, and optional ''qualifier'' slot(s). This
  ''SPOQ'' pattern is used to structure the meaning of the Statement''s "proposition"
  - the ''possible fact'' it assesses or reports to be true.


  SEPIO supports two "modes of use" for Statements, which differ in what they say
  about their SPOQ proposition, and can be distinguished by whether ''direction''
  and ''strength'' attributes are populated:


  "Assertion Mode" - the Statement simply reports an SPOQ proposition to be true  (e.g.
  that "BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer").  The ''direction'' and
  ''strength'' attributes are not populated, in this mode, which is used by projects
  reporting conclusive assertions about a domain of discourse.


  "Proposition Assessment Mode" - Statements describe the overall state of evidence
  and/or confidence surrounding the SPOQ proposition - which may or may not be true.
  The ''direction'' and ''strength'' attributes are are populated to support this
  mode, which allows for Statements  like"there is very strong evidence supporting
  the proposition that ''BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer''", or "we
  have high confidence that the proposition  ''BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G is pathogenic for Breast
  Cancer'' is false").  This mode is used in curation projects tracking the evolving
  state of support for propositions of interest, as curators continue to collect and
  assess evidence and work toward a conclusive assertion.'

    comments:
    - When applied to represent a particular type of Statement (via 'Profiling'),
      implementers can define a value set of predicates for the relationships relevant
      in the domain - ideally using terms from community ontologies or terminologies.
      For example, in a  'Variant Pathogenicity Statement' Profile, the predicate
      value set might include terms from the GENO ontology defining  'pathogenic for
      condition', 'benign for condition', and 'uncertain significance for condition'
      relationships (GENO:0000840, GENO:0000843, GENO:0000845).

    comments:
    - "The qualifier attribute allows representation of more complex, n-ary statements\
      \ that may not be accommodated by a simple subject-predicate-object (SPO) triple.\
      \ For example, if a triple asserts that 'Variant X' - predicts sensitivity to\
      \ - 'Treatment Y', a qualifier can be used to indicate that this applies in\
      \ the context of a particular 'Disease Z'. Qualifiers can also add information\
      \ that quantifies aspects of a Statement - e.g. for a Statement triple asserting\
      \ that a 'Variant X'- causes - 'Phenotype Y', a qualifier can be used to add\
      \ frequency/penetrance information that quantifies the percentage of carriers\
      \ in which the phenotype is observed to manifest. Statement profiles may define\
      \ more than one qualifier, as needed to capture different types of qualifying\
      \ information. \n\nThe SEPIO core model specifies use of a key-value 'Qualifier'\
      \ object to capture the meaning and value of each type of qualifying information\
      \ relevant for a given type of Statement. But in practice, profiles for specific\
      \ Statement types may choose to define one or more specializations of the generic\
      \ 'qualifier' property as named attributes. This makes the data more succinct\
      \ and parsable, and allows specific constraints to be applied and validated\
      \ for different qualifiers. For example, a VariantPathogenicityStatement profile\
      \ may define a named 'alleleOriginQualifier' attribute that is required, and\
      \ a named 'geneContextQualifier' attribute that is optional - both of which\
      \ conceptually specialize the core-im 'qualifier' property. Under this approach,\
      \ the core 'qualifier' acts as a placeholder to seed such specializations, but\
      \ is not used directly in Statement profiles."

    - This contrasts with hasEvidence and hasEvidenceLine attributes that describe
      specific instances of evidence information, such as a particular data item,

      as evidence (i.e. 'Evidence Items).
    comments:
    - 'Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information
      to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition. These arguments
      have direction (supporting / disputing) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate,
      weak) relative to the Proposition they are evaluated against. For example, ExaC
      allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G variant in
      different populations may be collectively assessed to provide an argument of
      ''moderate'' strength in ''support of '' a proposition that the variant is pathogenicity
      for breast cancer.


      Evidence Lines are useful in cases where a data provider wants to describe in

    - Statements put forth a Proposition that expresses some possible fact about the
      world, and may provide an assessment of this proposition's validity (i.e. how
      likely it is to be true or false based on evaluated evidence). The semantics
      of the Proposition are captured in the 'subject,' 'predicate', 'object', and
      optional 'qualifier' attributes. The assessment of the Proposition's validity
      are captured in 'direction', 'strength', and 'score' attributes. The 'strength'
      attribute is used to report the strength of this assessment in the direction
      indicated. Tee assessment can frame strength as a level of confidence that the
      Proposition is true or false, or as a  level of evidence that supports or disputes
      it. Data creators can define the permissible values for the 'strength' attribute
      to indicate which of these facets is being assessed (e.g. 'high confidence'
      vs 'low confidence', or 'strong evidence' vs 'weak evidence') - or they can
      chose values that don't commit to one or the other if they don't want to make
      the distinction (e.g. 'high' vs 'medium' vs 'low').

    comments:
    - "The qualifier attribute allows representation of more complex, n-ary statements\
      \ that may not be accommodated by a simple subject-predicate-object (SPO) triple.\
      \ For example, if a triple asserts that 'Variant X' - predicts sensitivity to\
      \ - 'Treatment Y', a qualifier can be used to indicate that this applies in\
      \ the context of a particular 'Disease Z'. Qualifiers can also add information\
      \ that quantifies aspects of a Statement - e.g. for a Statement triple asserting\
      \ that a 'Variant X'- causes - 'Phenotype Y', a qualifier can be used to add\
      \ frequency/penetrance information that quantifies the percentage of carriers\
      \ in which the phenotype is observed to manifest. Statement profiles may define\
      \ more than one qualifier, as needed to capture different types of qualifying\
      \ information. \n\nThe SEPIO core model specifies use of a key-value 'Qualifier'\
      \ object to capture the meaning and value of each type of qualifying information\
      \ relevant for a given type of Statement. But in practice, profiles for specific\
      \ Statement types may choose to define one or more specializations of the generic\
      \ 'qualifier' property as named attributes. This makes the data more succinct\
      \ and parsable, and allows specific constraints to be applied and validated\
      \ for different qualifiers. For example, a VariantPathogenicityStatement profile\
      \ may define a named 'alleleOriginQualifier' attribute that is required, and\
      \ a named 'geneContextQualifier' attribute that is optional - both of which\
      \ conceptually specialize the core-im 'qualifier' property. Under this approach,\
      \ the core 'qualifier' acts as a placeholder to seed such specializations, but\
      \ is not used directly in Statement profiles."

    comments:
    - The term 'authored' is used in the model to refer to the generation of abstract
      'information content', as opposed to creation of a concrete encoding of this
      information in a specific language, format, or physical artifact. e.g. for a
      Statement, this attribute captures when the information content expressed in
      the Statement was first  generated by an agent, and metadata about when a particular
      concrete encoding of this information was created (e.g. a written sentence in
      an article, or json object in a data stream) would live in a RecordMetadata
      object attached to the Information Entity).

    comments:
    - '- This is typically based on the quality of design and execution of the study
      or curation activity that generated it (e.g. were relevant controls assessed
      to show instruments were working, were all samples taken care of and handled
      identically, are methods sound and well documented, etc.).

      - The quality of information is intrinsic to the information itself, and not
      to a particular application of the information (e.g. as evidence for making
      an Assertion)

      - The quality of information is one factor that goes into the confidence we
      have in the information''s veracity (i.e. that it is an accurate reflection
      of reality it intends to measure or describe). Other factors informing confidence
      may include who did it (we may just not trust some Agents), when (if data created
      500 years ago, we may have less confidence in it), and for Assertions, the relevance
      and abundance of supporting evidence.

      - Implementers should define a relevant source or specific set of terms to use
      here based on the needs of the domain or application.'

      to capture when, how, and by whom a record serialization was generated or modified;
      what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level administrative
      information such as versioning and lifecycle status.

      Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical
      ids - typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that is assigned
      to the data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer may choose
      to reuse an existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority
      for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique
      within the implementing system, and can be used to reference the identified
      object in this context.'

      A given real world entity - e.g. a genetic variant - may have many business
      identifiers defined by different systems, which can be captured in the ''identifiers''
      property to indicate that they represent the same thing.


      Preferred values for this attribute are CURIEs or URIs - so the system that
      provisioned the identifier is clear.'
