    skos:note "Evidence Lines are flexible with respect to the granularity of arguments they support, and the scope of evidence items they can collectively assess. Narrow scoping will bucket available evidence into many, fine-grained Evidence Lines that make the most atomic independently meaningful arguments possible. The ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Interpretation Guidelines are an example of a fairly fine-grained evidence interpretation framework. Broader scoping approaches may organize the same available evidence into fewer Evidence Lines that build and assess less atomic arguments based on a wider and more diverse set of evidence items.  For example, CIViC curators assess the strength and direction of evidence items at the level of *all information reported in a publication for a specific study* - which can encompass many different results and evidence types that under more fine-grained interpretation approaches might be split apart and assessed as separate lines of evidence.",
        "Evidence Lines are used to capture various pieces of information (i.e. 'evidence items') that are assessed together as an argument for or against some 'target proposition' - to report the direction (supports or disputes) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate, weak) that the argument is determined to make. For example, the various allele counts and population frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant in the ExAC database are evidence items that may be collectively assessed to build an EvidenceLine making argument of 'moderate' strength that 'supports' a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.",
        "This CIViC EID5682 record (https://civicdb.org/evidence/5682/summary) is a clear example of this - illustrating how ACMG-curated evidence assessed at a finer-grained level would lend itself to SEPIO representations that creates a larger number of more atomic Evidence Lines, as compared to how CIViC-curated evidence from the same source or publication would be represented. We see here that CIViC evidence assessments are performed at the level of all results reported in PMID:23143947 - which SEPIO would capture as a single Evidence Line that assigns a strength (level C) and direction (supports) to the collective argument made by this evidence. However, as detailed in the free-text summary of this EID, the more fine-grained ACMG framework breaks out and separately assess two arguments here - one based on criterion PP1 (disease co-segregation evidence), and one based on criterion PP4 (highly specific gene-phenotype information) - which SEPIO woudl capture as two distinct Evidence Lines." .

        "As an example, consider the comprehensive allele frequency dataset provided by gnomAD, which covers millions of variants. A curator looking to assess the pathogenicity of a particular variant might create a StudyResult object to capture a subset of data related to this focus allele, including  its count, frequency, homozygous frequency, along with metadata concerning the shared provenance or quality of this data. The StudyResult could then be references as a piece of evidence used to inform the focus alleles final pathogenicity classification.",

A StudyResult might be used to organize the data from a simple, small scale bench experiment - e.g. a western blot analysis of protein expression, or an in vitro binding assay focused on a single protein.  Even such small 'studies' can generate multiple data items and metadata, and a StudyResult object can be used to collect all or some of these data points pertinent to a particular focus into an organized structure." .
