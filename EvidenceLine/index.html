<p><em>An independent, evidence-based argument that may support or refute the validity of a specific proposition. The strength and direction of this argument is based on an interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence for or against the target proposition.</em></p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Evidence Lines are used to capture various pieces of information (i.e. 'evidence items') that are assessed together as an argument for or against some 'target proposition' - to report the direction (supports or disputes) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate, weak) that the argument is determined to make. For example, the various allele counts and population frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G variant in the ExAC database are evidence items that may be collectively assessed to build an EvidenceLine making argument of 'moderate' strength that 'supports' a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.</li>
<li>Evidence Lines are flexible with respect to the granularity of arguments they support, and the scope of evidence items they can collectively assess. Narrow scoping will bucket available evidence into many, fine-grained Evidence Lines that make the most atomic independently meaningful arguments possible. The ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Interpretation Guidelines are an example of a fairly fine-grained evidence interpretation framework. Broader scoping approaches may organize the same available evidence into fewer Evidence Lines that build and assess less atomic arguments based on a wider and more diverse set of evidence items.  For example, CIViC curators assess the strength and direction of evidence items at the level of <em>all information reported in a publication for a specific study</em> - which can encompass many different results and evidence types that under more fine-grained interpretation approaches might be split apart and assessed as separate lines of evidence.</li>
<li>This CIViC EID5682 record (https://civicdb.org/evidence/5682/summary) is a clear example of this - illustrating how ACMG-curated evidence assessed at a finer-grained level would lend itself to SEPIO representations that creates a larger number of more atomic Evidence Lines, as compared to how CIViC-curated evidence from the same source or publication would be represented. We see here that CIViC evidence assessments are performed at the level of all results reported in PMID:23143947 - which SEPIO would capture as a single Evidence Line that assigns a strength (level C) and direction (supports) to the collective argument made by this evidence. However, as detailed in the free-text summary of this EID, the more fine-grained ACMG framework breaks out and separately assess two arguments here - one based on criterion PP1 (disease co-segregation evidence), and one based on criterion PP4 (highly specific gene-phenotype information) - which SEPIO woudl capture as two distinct Evidence Lines.</li>

<p>The possible fact against which evidence items contained in an Evidence Line were collectively evaluated, in determining the overall strength and direction of support they provide. For example, in an ACMG Guideline-based assessment of variant pathogenicity, the support provided by distinct lines of evidence are assessed against a target proposition that some variant is pathogenic for a specific disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary>Implementation Guidance</summary>
* An example based on the ACMG Guidelines for germline variant pathogenicity interpretation: Consider a curator assessing the evidence provided by population frequency data for a specific variant based on the ACMG criteria. In order to assign a strength (e.g. moderate vs strong) and direction (supports vs disputes) to this data as evidence, there must be some 'target proposition' toward which the evidence is assessed - which in this cases is the proposition that the variant is pathogenic for the disease of interest. If the PM2 criteria is deemed 'met', this indicates that the population frequency evidence provides 'moderate' (strength) 'support' (direction) for this target proposition.<br/>

<summary>Implementation Guidance</summary>
* A given Evidence Line may be supported by one or many individual evidence items. What matters is that all evidence items in a given Evidence Line get collectively assessed and assigned direction and strength  as a single argument for or against a target proposition.<br/>
* Different types and scales of information entity can serve as evidence (experimental measurements or observations, data tables or figures, images, prior assertions, etc.) Only when assessed as evidence do we consider the information to be an 'Evidence Item'.  For example, a piece of population frequency data about BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G  becomes an Evidence Item when it is assessed for the support it may offer for a target proposition (e.g. the prospect of the variant’s pathogenicity).<br>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: EvidenceLine
description: An independent, evidence-based argument that may support or refute the
  validity of a specific proposition. The strength and direction of this argument
  is based on an interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence for
  or against the target proposition.
title: Evidence Line
comments:
- Evidence Lines are used to capture various pieces of information (i.e. 'evidence
  items') that are assessed together as an argument for or against some 'target proposition'
  - to report the direction (supports or disputes) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate,
  weak) that the argument is determined to make. For example, the various allele counts
  and population frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G variant in the ExAC
  database are evidence items that may be collectively assessed to build an EvidenceLine
  making argument of 'moderate' strength that 'supports' a target proposition that
  the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.
- Evidence Lines are flexible with respect to the granularity of arguments they support,
  and the scope of evidence items they can collectively assess. Narrow scoping will
  bucket available evidence into many, fine-grained Evidence Lines that make the most
  atomic independently meaningful arguments possible. The ACMG Variant Pathogenicity
  Interpretation Guidelines are an example of a fairly fine-grained evidence interpretation
  framework. Broader scoping approaches may organize the same available evidence into
  fewer Evidence Lines that build and assess less atomic arguments based on a wider
  and more diverse set of evidence items.  For example, CIViC curators assess the
  strength and direction of evidence items at the level of *all information reported
  in a publication for a specific study* - which can encompass many different results
  and evidence types that under more fine-grained interpretation approaches might
  be split apart and assessed as separate lines of evidence.
- This CIViC EID5682 record (https://civicdb.org/evidence/5682/summary) is a clear
  example of this - illustrating how ACMG-curated evidence assessed at a finer-grained
  level would lend itself to SEPIO representations that creates a larger number of
  more atomic Evidence Lines, as compared to how CIViC-curated evidence from the same
  source or publication would be represented. We see here that CIViC evidence assessments
  are performed at the level of all results reported in PMID:23143947 - which SEPIO
  would capture as a single Evidence Line that assigns a strength (level C) and direction
  (supports) to the collective argument made by this evidence. However, as detailed
  in the free-text summary of this EID, the more fine-grained ACMG framework breaks
  out and separately assess two arguments here - one based on criterion PP1 (disease
  co-segregation evidence), and one based on criterion PP4 (highly specific gene-phenotype
  information) - which SEPIO woudl capture as two distinct Evidence Lines.

      frequency data for a specific variant based on the ACMG criteria. In order to
      assign a strength (e.g. moderate vs strong) and direction (supports vs disputes)

      the evidence is assessed - which in this cases is the proposition that the variant

    comments:
    - A given Evidence Line may be supported by one or many individual evidence items.
      What matters is that all evidence items in a given Evidence Line get collectively
      assessed and assigned direction and strength  as a single argument for or against
      a target proposition.
    - Different types and scales of information entity can serve as evidence (experimental
      measurements or observations, data tables or figures, images, prior assertions,
      etc.) Only when assessed as evidence do we consider the information to be an
      'Evidence Item'.  For example, a piece of population frequency data about BRCA2
      c.8023A&gt;G  becomes an Evidence Item when it is assessed for the support it may
      offer for a target proposition (e.g. the prospect of the variant’s pathogenicity).

    - Values of this attribute can be defined by for a given profile based on domain/application
      needs, but should be framed in qualitative terms (e.g. 'strong', 'moderate',
      'weak'). The 'scoreOfEvidenceProvided' attribute can be used to report quantitative
      assessments of evidence provided.

    comments:
    - This is a 'shortcut relation' that can be used to directly link an Evidence
      Line to sources of its supporting Evidence Items, without having to represent
      those Evidence Items directly. Populate with the name or uri or curie of a source
      of information. Future work will define a more formal framework for referencing
      information sources.

    - e.g. In the context of a Statement object, this attribute may be used to indicate
      entities/concepts it is about, in lieu of providing a more precise description
      of what the Statement asserts to be true using subject, predicate, object, and
      qualifier properties. e.g. the Statement that "BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G is pathogenic
      for Breast Cancer" might be annotated to be about the variant 'BRCA2 c.8023A&gt;G',
      and the disease 'Breast Cancer'.

    comments:
    - The term 'authored' as used in the model refers to the generation of 'information
      content' in the abstract  sense, as opposed to a concrete encoding of this information
      in a specific language or format. e.g. for a Statement, this attribute captures
      when the information content expressed in the Statement was first generated
      by an agent.  Information about when a particular concrete encoding of this
      information was created (e.g. as row in a table, or object in a json document)
      would live in a RecordMetadata object attached to the Information Entity).

      cpz1.1045) - as opposed to reporting a *type* of method applied (e.g. "Transmission

  informationQuality:
    name: informationQuality
    description: A qualitative term indicating the scientific rigor or reliability
      with which the information was generated/collected.
    comments:
    - This is typically based on the quality of design and execution of the study
      or curation activity that generated it (e.g. were relevant controls assessed
      to show instruments were working, were all samples taken care of and handled
      identically, are methods sound and well documented, etc.).
    - The quality of information is intrinsic to the information itself, and not to
      a particular application of the information (e.g. as evidence for making an
      Assertion)
    - The quality of information is one factor that goes into the confidence we have
      in the information''s veracity (i.e. that it is an accurate reflection of reality
      it intends to measure or describe). Other factors informing confidence may include
      who did it (we may just not trust some Agents), when (if data created 500 years
      ago, we may have less confidence in it), and for Assertions, the relevance and
      abundance of supporting evidence.
    - Implementers should define a relevant source of codes or terms to use here,
      based on the needs of the domain or application.'

    comments:
    - This attribute holds a structured RecordMetadata objects, which can be used
      to capture when, how, and by whom a record serialization was generated or modified;
      what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level administrative
      information such as versioning and lifecycle status.

      from another.
    comments:
    - Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical
      ids - typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that is assigned
      to the data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer may choose
      to reuse an existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority
      for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique
      within the implementing system, and can be used to reference the identified
      object in this context.

      across different systems.
    comments:
    - Preferred values for this attribute are CURIEs or URIs - so the system that
      provisioned the identifier is clear.
    - A given real world entity - e.g. a genetic variant - may have many business
      identifiers defined by different systems, which can be captured in the "identifiers"
      property to indicate that they represent the same thing.

      between systems.
